This is a fully functioning four-function calculator that can handle PMDAS, decimals, and parenthesis. It also looks cute.

## The How
I used JavaScript to write a simple (or, so you would think) four-function calculator. This calculator detects user key presses or clicks on the displayed buttons to input numbers, decimals, operands, and parenthesis. Given this input, I have two functions: MDAS and perform. Perform is how I mitigate parenthesis, and once I have isolated the input within parenthesis, it will go into MDAS. This ensures that PMDAS will work no matter how many nested parenthesis you enter.

My HTML and CSS design was based off an old-school classic idea of a four function calculator. I really took inspiration from the crusty ones they gave out in seventh grade science class. There is a light and dark mode because why would programmers not include a dark mode? The buttons on the calculator not only look great but are fully functioning as well. So, you can either fast-type your calculations on a keyboard or take the nostalgic approach and press those buttons one at a time.

## The Why
I wrote this code as part of a summer internship. The purpose of completing this project was to get me started into web development. This calculator is the first time I have used HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. It was a great way to introduce me to these new languages in a fun, approachable way. Additionally, I completed this project for a hypothetical "customer" using the Agile method. I communicated expectations for the calculator with the customer and displayed my final product after meeting the requirements.

## The When
Summer of 2022, during a software engineering internship.
